## Swarm Summit 2024: Upload the Future — What to Expect & Beyond

Much has unfolded since last year’s virtual Summit, with the Swarm Foundation making significant progress. Highlights include the milestone release of Bee 2.0, positioning Swarm as the leading decentralised, permissionless and censorship-resistant storage solution, numerous events and the important governance vote that engaged the wider community. The Swarm Team is ready and excited to share the future prospects, already focusing on Swarm 3.0.

The Summit will lay the groundwork for exploring future features and expanding the ecosystem, while also offering fresh insights from the team behind Swarm, and opportunities to hear eminent speakers share their views on the current state and the future of Web3.

The Summit will unfold with an afterparty featuring a live performance by [Modeselektor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Sp8Vhwts6U): flying in from Berlin, _Modeselektor_ will be keeping the energy high with their multi-genre electronic music grooves known to shake dancefloors and raise heartbeats as well as eyebrows.  

The following day will take attendees to [Bled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality_of_Bled) for a relaxing experience in beautiful surroundings.

But before all of that, the Swarm Foundation team and community will gather in Ljubljana to kick off our adventure with two days of innovation, collaboration, idea sharing, and hacking at the Swarm Hackdays. 


## Swarm Hackdays, 18–19 June

For two days, we will set up our basecamp at the [Computer Museum](https://www.racunalniski-muzej.si/en/home-english/) to collaborate on hacking projects revolving around video streaming on Swarm, in-browser clients, access control apps, chat applications, blobstore, and data availability. 

Although the special Hack grants call is now closed, those of you who still wish to participate will be welcomed on the spot or online with productive ideas and solutions. A dedicated [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/799027393297514537/1237352694419816468) has been established to discuss Hackdays- and Summit-related topics.


## Swarm Summit, 20–21 June – MAIN EVENT

The Swarm Summit ([RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/ethereum-swarm/events/301034793)), set in [Kino Šiška, Ljubljana](https://www.visitljubljana.com/en/poi/kino-siska-centre-for-urban-culture/), will be packed with presentations, with the programme running from 10:00/11:00 to 17:00/18:00 CET each day. It promises to be an **unforgettable experience bringing together the Swarm community and experts**, covering a wide array of topics, including _media streaming_,_ transcoding services_, _content incentives_, _data availability plans,_ and _decentralised AI_. Attendees can look forward to deep tech talks, exploring use cases, participating in workshops, and following presentations that promise to deepen their understanding and engagement with the Swarm network and its prospects.

And  that's not all! There will also be plenty of time for networking, providing you with an opportunity to meet the builders and visionaries shaping the future with today's technology.

Stay alert for posts revealing the full schedule in the coming days.

### Party with Swarm and the legendary Modeselektor live!

After the Summit concludes on Friday, there will be an afterparty at the same venue, featuring a live performance by [Modeselektor](https://www.kinosiska.si/en/dogodek/modeselektor/) as the evening’s headliner, in co-production with Kino Šiška.

 **Time to let loose and have fun**!



Modeselektor are the legendary and heavily influential Berlin DJ duo that have been shaping the electronic music scene with their flamboyant DJ sets and genre-melding productions, shifting from IDM to glitch, electro house and hip-hop, topping the sets off with their cheeky, absurdist sense of humour. The authorities of modern electronica.

Join us for this rare opportunity to experience Modeselektor live for an electrifying performance and a night to remember!


## Chill and Relax in Bled, 22 June

On the last day, we will head to [Bled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality_of_Bled), a world-renowned destination known for its breathtaking natural beauty, and gather at the [Subwork co-working space](https://subwork.xyz/), crypto and AI hub in the most beautiful natural surroundings.
