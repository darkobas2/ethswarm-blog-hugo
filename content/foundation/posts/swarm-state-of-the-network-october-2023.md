### Data Considerations

- In order to improve the accuracy and relevance of network metrics, we have updated our data reporting methodology to include both nodes which have won and also those which have not won within each month.
- "Active staking nodes" are defined as nodes which have submitted at least one commit transaction within the month in question. Nodes which are staked but have not submitted a commit transaction within the month are not counted as active.

## Network Total Monthly Rewards

This metric shows the total rewards paid out across the entire network for each month.

| Month     | Total Network Rewards (xBZZ) |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| May       | 21423                        |
| June      | 26655                        |
| July      | 34839                        |
| August    | 135927                       |
| September | 147825                       |
| October   | 152868                       |

![chart-Total-Network-Monthly-Rewards](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJkzEFs76.png)

In October, the Swarm network distributed a total of 152,868 xBZZ in rewards, marking the highest monthly payout within the six-month period. This significant reward amount in October underscores a robust growth in network activity and engagement.

## Monthly Average Win Values

This metric is the average win amount for each win event.

| Month     | Average Win Values (xBZZ) |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| May       | 8.29                      |
| June      | 10.14                     |
| July      | 12.07                     |
| August    | 41.45                     |
| September | 46.52                     |
| October   | 62.09                     |

![chart-Monthly-Average-Win-Values](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJxKVto7p.png)

For October, the average win value reached 62.09 xBZZ, the highest in the observed period. This peak in October indicates a substantial increase in the value of individual win events, reflecting an increase in network activity.

## Monthly Median Win Values

This metric is the median win amount for each win event.

| Month     | Median Win Values (xBZZ) |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| May       | 6.40                     |
| June      | 8.29                     |
| July      | 9.63                     |
| August    | 43.97                    |
| September | 44.62                    |
| October   | 46.84                    |

![chart-Monthly-Median-Win-Values](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkMHHKjQ6.png)

The median win value in October was 46.84, also the highest in the six-month timeline. This suggests that the typical win value for nodes has grown considerably, aligning with the overall upward trend in network usage.

## Active Staking Node Monthly Average Earnings

This metric shows the average monthly earnings for an active staking node, with active staking node defined as a staked node which has submitted at least one commit transaction within the month, regardless of whether or not they have won a reward in that month.

| Month     | Avg Total Earnings per Node (xBZZ) |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| May       | 8.47                               |
| June      | 10.73                              |
| July      | 13.11                              |
| August    | 31.11                              |
| September | 32.31                              |
| October   | 14.73                              |

![chart-Avg-Total-Earnings-per-Node](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkmVLFjQT.png)

_(Note that this metric is lower across all months than in previous reports as we have retroactively included active staking nodes which did not win within each month.)_

In October, the average earnings per active staking node dipped to 14.73 xBZZ. Although this is a significant decrease from September, when taken in light of the higher average win values per win event, it is evidence of an increasingly competitive network environment driven by the influx of new staking nodes rather than of a drop in network activity.

## Total Active Staking Nodes by Month

![Total Staking Nodes by Country(4).png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1yOfFomT.png)

October witnessed a dramatic increase in active staking nodes from China, totaling 6,242, alongside significant numbers from Germany and Finland. This shift underscores the continuing expansion in the network's geographical diversity and participation, particularly highlighting the growing interest and involvement in the Swarm network from the Chinese region.

## Conclusion

Over the last six months, the Swarm network has shown substantial growth and increased activity. This is evident from the rising total monthly rewards, average and median win values, and the average earnings per active staking node. The number of active nodes, both staking and non-staking, has significantly increased, with a notable rise in active staking nodes, especially from countries like China, Germany, and Finland. The data indicates not only a growing interest in the Swarm network but also an evolving ecosystem with increasing rewards and participation, reflecting its expanding global footprint and the potential for decentralized storage solutions.
