**Zug, Switzerland — 6 February 2021**

Swarm Association is pleased to announce the successful completion of its private fundraiser that ended with the recent Swarm Live release, raising USD 6 million.

Gregor Žavcer, Operation Lead at Swarm comments: “The successful completion of the private fundraising is a crucial step forward for Swarm to secure funds for development towards our vision of making the world computer real. Swarm is by nature a collaborative effort and we greatly value our relationship with Swarm’s early supporters who enabled the development of the platform. It is together that we continue our mission of empowering digital freedom, partnering to bring our solutions closer to users and creating a positive social impact.”

Swarm has been conducting deep research for four years. This resulted in the [Book of Swarm](https://gateway.ethswarm.org/bzz/latest.bookofswarm.eth/), a technical deep dive, internally nicknamed the “blueprint for web3”, introducing an incentivized storage and communication service to extend blockchains into a world computer. Such base-layer infrastructure will serve as the operating system of the serverless internet that hosts and runs dApps. The secured funds will result in Swarm version 1.0, which will be released in Q2 this year.

In spite of the overwhelming response, part of BZZ tokens allocated to fundraising are reserved for a public sale near the 1.0 release. We plan to announce the details of the public sale as soon as they are confirmed.

Swarm conducted its private fundraising together with Bitcoin Suisse, Switzerland‘s oldest and largest crypto-financial service provider, building on its extensive experience in digital asset capital markets and token sales.

Lothar Cerjak, Head of Institutional Services and Products at Bitcoin Suisse commented: “We are excited to support leading projects in the growing ecosystem and to help bring innovation to life. Swarm is one of those projects. It builds towards a strong vision of decentralized computation and storage, has its roots in the Ethereum project, and has become one of the most anticipated projects over its many years of development. I am proud that we could offer our clients this exclusive opportunity and we look forward to assisting Swarm in its exciting journey ahead.”
