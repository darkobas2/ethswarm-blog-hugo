December is the closing month of the year and most of the teams took time to reflect on the work that was done throughout the year. We are happy to conclude that the year was fruitful for Swarm. Many important milestones were met and a lot of progress was made.

Four versions of Swarm were released, the Book of Swarm was published and the ecosystem is now quickly expanding. Many interesting projects have started to build their dApps on top of Swarm and many new Bee nodes were installed.

Apart from the reflections and some minor reorganisations in the team, work was being done at the usual brisk pace. We are inviting you to dive in and read the report here below.

**Core Track**

- Released [Bee](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/releases/tag/v0.4.1) (v0.4.1), here you can have a look at the release notes
- Work on developing postage stamps, which is a way content owners can signal the importance of the content to node operators
- Prepare support for Bee running as a Windows Service
- Feed resolution inside Bee

**DevOps Track**

- Deployed [Bee](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee) (v0.4.1) to the public cluster.
- Released a new version of the [Bee Helm chart](https://github.com/ethersphere/helm/tree/master/charts/bee) (v0.6.2).
