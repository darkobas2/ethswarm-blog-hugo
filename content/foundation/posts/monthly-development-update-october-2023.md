October has seen some important shifts in the wider Swarm ecosystem. The **Bee Track** successfully released **[Bee 1.17.5](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/releases/tag/v1.17.5)** featuring smaller but impactful improvements. The team’s next steps are focused on refining the upload and download experiences, along with diligent monitoring of data longevity.

Concurrently, the **Research Track** wrapped up development on Phases 3 and 4 of the [storage incentives roadmap](https://blog.ethswarm.org/foundation/2022/towards-the-world-computer.-the-swarm-network-upgrade-has-started./), focusing on rigorous quality assurance to ensure both normal and edge-case performance standards are met. Additionally, everything is ready for the new **Sepolia testnet** to go live. The **JS Track** also rolled out a new [Swarm Desktop App](https://www.ethswarm.org/build/desktop) compatible with Bee 1.17.5 and a new version of Etherproxy with multi-target support.

Jumping over to the Ecosystem section: If you are looking for a way to bring your project into the growing Swarm network, the [Swarm Full Moon Grant Wave](https://my.ethswarm.org/grants) might just be the thing, so don’t hesitate to apply. [Fairdrive](https://blog.ethswarm.org/foundation/2022/towards-the-world-computer.-the-swarm-network-upgrade-has-started./) has new user-centric features and a **[fresh beta tester campaign for the Fairdrive Web App](https://twitter.com/FairDataSociety/status/1720050064305828218)** is out.

[Swarm’s docs](https://docs.ethswarm.org/) are now even better with new sections for node operators and general updated texts. And last but not least, the next **Swarm Community Call** is on 30 November, but you can already send your questions to the teams [via this form](https://airtable.com/shrBRyrMkXFsJvLS3).

## Tracks
