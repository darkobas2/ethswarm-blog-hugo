## Conclusion

The data from May highlights significant shifts and adaptations within the Swarm network. While the total number of active staking nodes has decreased, this reduction along with an increase in total network monthly rewards has led to an increase in average earnings per node. The uptick in total network rewards and average win values suggests a positive trend, indicating robust activity and engagement. These changes underscore the dynamic nature of the Swarm network, showcasing its ability to adapt and sustain profitability for active nodes despite fluctuations in participation.
