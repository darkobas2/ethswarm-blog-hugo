It’s official! The Swarm team is proud to announce that the Swarm mainnet has launched.

Bee 1.0 has been released and is running on mainnet. This means everybody can now join in creating the Swarm mainnet network. This is a historical moment in the history of Swarm.

Node operators that wish to continue operating testnet nodes should start their nodes anew and should cash out cheques before updating. You can still run a testnet Bee: it helps the dev team to have a quality testing environment.

**What do node operators need to do?**

Node operators can download and run Bee 1.0. nodes. Additionally, node operators should have an xDAI endpoint configured and passed as the — swap-endpoint flag.

**Where to find documentation?**

This very first upload marks this historic moment: b11c8ba7922e10c69fef94365892a945dd7f56535a3869ed9247b6d453c7ef93
