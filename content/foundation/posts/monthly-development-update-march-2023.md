## The go-libp2p has been upgraded

**Bee client is now version 1.13.0 and is bringing breaking changes**. This includes the upgrade of the go-libp2p, which uses a new format for the p2p keys. The update will exclude nodes from storage incentives unless they have enough balance to cover at least five storage-incentives-related transactions.

## The price oracle model is all set up

The **price oracle model is set up** and is being continuously tested and developed in a cluster. The development of Phase 4 of the storage incentives roadmap is running in parallel and you can also check out the new [Storage incentives paper here](https://t.co/v7MGmMJikG).

## A new Swarm Desktop is out

On the UI side of things, the **JS Track** has released a **new Swarm Desktop version** ([0.20.0](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-desktop/releases/tag/v0.20.0)) to include the latest changes in the Bee client. They have made numerous upgrades and bug fixes in the latest [Swarm-CLI](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-cli/releases) and [Bee-JS](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-js/releases).

## New updates in the Fair Data stack

The **Fair Data Protocol** released a **new version of** **the Fairdrive Desktop App, FairOS, fdp-storage, Blossom** and published a new [**FIP**](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/FIPs/pull/71).

## Bounties, good data upload, a how-to blog and Ethereum Zurich

The **Ecosystem** is also buzzing with activity. We invite you to check out the open bounties and if your project is focused on doing social good, the Swarm Odyssey Data Upload sponsorship initiative is now sponsoring good data uploads to Swarm. You can also show your support for privacy and digital freedom by getting yourself some awesome swag in the [Freedom shop](https://freedomshop.org/collections/swarm).

If you’re interested in future-proofing your website, the [new blog ](https://blog.ethswarm.org/foundation/2023/how-to-publish-a-website-on-swarm-using-the-swarm-desktop-app-a-step-by-step-guide/)by the **DevRel** team shows you how to publish it on the Swarm network and give it that Web3 boost.

From 14–16 April, the Ethereum community will gather at a meetup in Zurich. Swarm's **Daniel A. Nagy** will be there to talk about the upcoming price oracle, and you can swing by our booth at any time for a friendly face-to-face chat with the team.

## Tracks

### **Bee Track**

##### New Bee Release [1.13.0](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/releases/tag/v1.13.0) was deployed – Breaking change

- The main focus of this release has been the upgrade of our communication library – go-libp2p, which uses a new format for the p2p keys.
