Last month was an amazing one for the Swarm team and the Swarm Foundation. Two very important milestones were achieved, and it’s fair to say they marked the beginning of a new era of Swarm.

First, the public token sale happened on 14 June 2021. Some 25,000 more people are now proud owners of BZZ token. Second, Swarm 1.0 was launched on mainnet.

The mainnet launch was celebrated with [an online event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjGky8BcWpw&list=PL6fQnFAjtuY9DhpZ9W0L8uIV9vz5vr34q), where the dev team explained what Swarm 1.0 is and what the plans are for the nearest future. Some really nice demos from the ecosystem followed, featuring some of the projects that are already building on Swarm. The event concluded with an interesting talk with the founders of Swarm.

The community launched the [Swarm bonding curve](https://bzz.exchange/), where users can buy BZZ and redeem DAI/ETH.

Although most of the team’s efforts were focusing on the mentioned milestones, some really good [side releases happened with the Bee-js track too](https://bit.ly/3xeQhu2). Dive into the monthly development update here below and check for yourself.

**Bee Track**
