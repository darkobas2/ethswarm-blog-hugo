ðŸŽ‰ Swarm Foundation is happy to announce the next stage of the Airdrop: the selection of trusted nodes.

In this blog post, Swarm announces two important changes with respect to the final stages of the airdrop:

1. There are over 5000 trusted nodes
2. The amount of BZZ that will be airdropped has been increased
3. All tokens will be airdropped directly on the xDai network, skipping the consolidation phase on Goerli

# 5000 trusted nodes

Due to the overwhelming success of the testnet and the seriously gigantic scale of the response to our call for node operators, the selection of trusted nodes has been expanded to a more appropriate number. Here are some quick stats:

- A massive **10.251.552** cheques were cashed with a non-zero value
- Over **302.000** nodes deployed chequebooks and cashed out at least one cheque from a peer

The goal of the airdrop was not only to reward those node operators who helped run the test network, but also to get BZZ in as many hands as possible so node operators can start running their Bees on mainnet and use the network for upload and download of data.

Because the network has been blessed with so many participants, the number of trusted nodes is extended from 35 to over 5000 nodes.

In the coming days, the Airdrop dashboard will be opened, which will show exactly how much BZZ each node is going to get on the 2nd of August. Keep an eye on our Twitter feed and follow the announcements in Discord to be the first to know.

# More winners

There will be more winners to the airdrop than originally envisioned. On top of the rewards that originate from interaction with a trusted node, _all_ nodes that deployed a chequebook and cashed out at least one cheque before the end of Jul 12, 2021 will be rewarded with 0.1BZZ. This is enough for a node operator to start using the Swarm main network.

# Airdrop directly on xDai

As Swarm 1.0 was deployed to the xDai network, which benefits from low transaction fees, the consolidation period is not required. As such, the tokens will be dropped immediately into your wallets on the xDai network. You may bridge your tokens over to the Ethereum network.

# Find out how much BZZ you get

The addresses of the trusted nodes are published [here](https://github.com/ethersphere/rise-of-bee-airdrop). In the upcoming days, a leaderboard will be released where you can see how much BZZ you will get airdropped on August 2nd on the xDai sidechain and on what address.

# Learn more

If you feel like discussing the airdrop, a dedicated chat channel was created in [Discord](https://discord.gg/y2ZRe8MUFG), so join the node operators and chat away. On [www.ethswarm.org/faqs.html](http://www.ethswarm.org/faqs.html) you will find a new section with Airdrop FAQ.

# Be careful out there

Be aware that there are many fake BZZ circulating and scams out there. Always do your own research and double-check the contracts and markets youâ€™re interacting with. Swarm Foundation does not have any representatives, neither global nor local. Swarm Foundation will only communicate via official channels that can be found on [www.ethswarm.org.](http://www.ethswarm.org./)
