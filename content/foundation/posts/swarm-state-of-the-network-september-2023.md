_11/10/23 - Correction - The average win rate for nodes in August was not greater than one._

Let's take a dive into the Swarm network's performance metrics for September. The details below offer a window into individual node earnings, win value statistics, and the geographical node distribution. By juxtaposing September's metrics with August's data, we can explore the network's growth patterns.

### Data Considerations:

All data in this report is based on nodes which have won the redistribution game at least once per month, nodes which have not won were not included.

### Network Total Monthly Rewards

This metric is the total monthly rewards paid out across the entire network.

| Month         | Total Rewards (BZZ) |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| April         | 20503               |
| May           | 21423               |

For September, nodes witnessed a marginal rise in their average earnings, reaching **69.56 BZZ**, a hair more than last month's average of 68.20 BZZ.

### Monthly Median Win Values

This metric is the median win amount for each win event.

| Month         | Median Win Value (BZZ) |

The average win values for September escalated to **46.52 BZZ**, a significant increase from August's 41.45 BZZ.

### Number of Staking Nodes by Month

This is determined by the number of unique staking nodes each month which have won at least once in that month (as noted above, it does not include nodes which did not win in that month).

| Month         | Number of Nodes |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| April         | 1434            |
| May           | 1443            |
