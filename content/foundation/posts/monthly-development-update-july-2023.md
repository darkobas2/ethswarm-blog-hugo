In July, a major step was taken for the Swarm network with the unveiling
of the new Localstore, which will be included in the latest [<u>Bee
1.17.0</u>](https://github.com/ethersphere). Phase 4 of the storage
incentives roadmap will also be released in the next few days, as will
the latest updates to the price oracle, which is currently being tested
extensively.

On the Ecosystem front, the [<u>Fairdrive Web
App</u>](https://app.fairdrive.fairdatasociety.org/) now boasts enhanced
security for wallet creation, coupled with some improvements and fixes.
Accessibility is the name of the game, so the [<u>Book of
Swarm</u>](https://www.ethswarm.org/The-Book-of-Swarm.pdf) is in the
middle of a polishing session and the [<u>Bee client specs
repo</u>](https://github.com/ethersphere/specs) is ready to roll.

Save the date for a new Swarm Community Call on 31 August and stay at
the forefront of these exciting developments!

## Tracks

### Bee Track

- The Localstore rewrite is complete, tested, and anticipated features, such as multi-stamping and local pinning, work as expected. And release of the 1.17.0 is scheduled in the coming days as announced on the Community Call this month.
- The hardening phase epic and documents have been created and added to both, internally and externally. We look forward to beginning work in this vein between and after our awaited breaking change scheduled releases.

### Research Track

- The phase 4 inclusion proof tests and refactorings are complete and awaiting bee-side test completion and a testnet release is imminent for phase 4.
- The price oracle coefficient values that manipulate the price have been recalibrated and the contract is complete – giving a better product experience, and these will be put to testnet in the coming weeks.
- The research team has also done extensive research and written documents on chain migration and omnichain support for Swarm and its implications for node operators, etc. as well as statistics on the variance of operator rewards.

### JS Track
