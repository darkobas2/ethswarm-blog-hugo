Free access to data and the ability to convert it into beneficial
insights for further societal advancement form the bedrock of a
flourishing community. Recognising this, Swarm Foundation has forged a
partnership with [Unbounded
Network](https://unbounded.network) Foundation and
[MiPasa](https://unbounded.network/) to streamline the
flow of information, making data more readily accessible and easy to
mould.

Summit**](https://swarm.streameth.org/session/Y7MWQ9)

As part of this partnership, MiPasa and Unbounded Network will take up
several grants provided by the Foundation. These grants include creating
Unbounded Network Connectors to Swarm that will allow the smooth and
seamless integration of Swarm\'s decentralised storage, producing a
proof-of-concept, a testing environment, and a production environment
with MiPasa.

## Together, we are making data collaborative and resilient

Our collaborative venture with Unbounded Network and MiPasa is designed
to make a variety of high-quality datasets accessible on a global scale.
Professionals will have the opportunity to refine these datasets and
leave them for others to further enhance. By storing these datasets on
the Swarm network, they will become much more resilient against loss or
inaccessibility, mitigating the risks of network blackouts or
censorship.

_"We believe that there are boundless possibilities and potential in
allowing people to easily store and access data, open it to the world,
and in addition to sharing the code/models and the results of the models
-- share these using Swarm. This way others can collaboratively utilise
the work that has already been done, calculations that have already been
performed, and add value by testing, reusing and/or verifying. Combining
computation, analytics with decentalised storage and global access is a
key milestone that both projects needed to create a global,
collaborative and borderless data and analytics ecosystem together,"_
stresses Jonathan Levi from MiPasa.

## About Unbounded Network

Unbounded Network is a high-performing overlay network connecting
people, apps and ecosystems across blockchain networks. As such, having
an Unbounded Connector for Swarm allows a seamless integration of
storing, reading and verifying data across multiple Unbounded Apps, and
in particular in MiPasa.

## About MiPasa

MiPasa is an innovative data-modelling and analytics platform that is a
valuable tool for data scientists, researchers and collaborative teams.
It enables the creation, collaboration and publication of verifiable,
data-driven models, reports and insights. Its integration with Swarm
will empower researchers and analysts to extract verified models and
data directly from Swarm, process and enrich it, and store them back to
Swarm, all from the comfort of their browsers.

## #PowerToThePeople

This partnership fortifies the Swarm network's commitment to making data
accessible for all, fostering a culture of free information flow. It
will enhance the quality of datasets available for professionals,
fuelling the knowledge generation process and, hopefully, contributing
towards a better world for everyone.

Join us and let's give back power, accessible data, and control over the
data to the people!
