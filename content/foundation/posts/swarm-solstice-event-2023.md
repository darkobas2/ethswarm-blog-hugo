#### #generate freedom

Swarm's creation was an act of defiance. A bold step towards a universe where digital freedom reigns supreme. Swarm is designed for those who dare to imagine a world beyond the monolithic data empires; those who believe that in order to maintain individuality only we, individuals themselves, may control our own digital identity and data; those who refuse to accept the dictate of users as products. It was created to inspire them to join the uprising!

As the network has been experiencing explosive growth over last few months, Swarm Foundation is proud to see that this is beginning to happen, that the word is spreading, and is more committed than ever to reaching all the remaining major milestones and delivering Swarm 2.0, the proper foundation on which the free – libre – digital world can be built, by the end of the year. But Swarm 2.0 is more than its technical aspect. It is a network, a community of users. Get your hands on the new Swarm 2.0!
