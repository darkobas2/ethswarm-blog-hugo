In the March edition of our "State of the Network" series, we provide an in-depth look at the Swarm network's metrics and the notable changes they have undergone. This month's report captures a dynamic period for the network, characterized by significant variations in rewards, participation, and geographical distribution of nodes. Through this analysis, stakeholders can gain insights into the evolving landscape of the Swarm network, marked by shifts in monthly rewards, win values, average earnings per node, and the global distribution of active nodes.

![Total Staking Nodes by Country.png](/uploads/Total-Active-Staking-Nodes-by-Country-March.png)

The geographic distribution of active staking nodes in March showed notable changes, with increases in nodes from China, Finland, and the "Other" category, while the "Unknown" category saw a substantial decrease. This suggests a shift in the geographical presence of active nodes.

## Conclusion

The trends observed in March underscore a period of adjustment and change within the Swarm network. Despite reductions in total rewards and active staking nodes, there was an increase in average earnings for active nodes, hinting at a more concentrated reward distribution. The geographical shifts indicate a broadening global engagement, especially with notable increases in active nodes from China and Finland. These changes, reflective of the network's dynamic nature, highlight the ongoing evolution of Swarm as it continues to adapt and grow within the decentralized ecosystem.
