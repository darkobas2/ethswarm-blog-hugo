![chart-Avg-Total-Earnings-per-Node](/uploads/chart-Avg-Total-Earnings-per-Node-March.png)

In line with the trend for other metrics, the average monthly earnings for an active staking node decreased significantly to 7.711 xBZZ in March, reflecting a downturn in earnings across active nodes.

## Total Active Staking Nodes by Month

This metric shows the total active staking nodes by month (again, defined as a node which has submitted a commit transaction at least once in the month).

![Total Staking Nodes by Country.png](/uploads/Total-Active-Staking-Nodes-by-Country-March.png)

The geographic distribution of active staking nodes in March showed notable changes, with increases in nodes from China, Finland, and "Other" countries, while the "Unknown" category saw a substantial increase. 

## Conclusion

The March report reveals a complex picture of adjustment within the Swarm network, highlighted by a decrease in total rewards but an increase in active staking nodes. This suggests a period of rebalancing and diversification in network participation and reward distribution. The geographical spread of nodes underscores the network's evolving global reach. As we continue to monitor these trends, the evolving dynamics of the Swarm network offer valuable insights into its resilience and adaptability in light of changing conditions.
