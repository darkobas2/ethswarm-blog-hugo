As the grant program expands, welcoming new projects with each wave, here's a list of FAQs to assist in navigating the program. From applying for a grant to the payout date, find the information you need below.

## I. Application & Submission Process

### Q1: Is there a template or portal available for grant submissions? 

A: There isn’t a one-size-fits-all template as the questionnaire might vary, but the questions generally revolve around grant milestone description, motivation for grant, budget, and community engagement. You can apply [here](https://my.ethswarm.org/grants).

### Q2: How should a large project worth over $10,000 be described and submitted? 

A: Describe the project as a whole and divide it into logical milestones. Each grant is a milestone of 10,000$. You can discuss your project’s milestones within the community on Discord for suggestions and feedback. Also, please note that you will need to apply for subsequent milestones.

### Q3: Where should the corrected or amended applications be sent? 

A: Corrected or amended applications can be resubmitted through the appropriate channels, as highlighted in our guidelines.

## II. Communication & Feedback

### Q4: Can we receive feedback on our submissions before officially submitting them? 

A: Due to a high volume of requests, the grant team cannot provide individual feedback. However, you’re encouraged to seek community feedback on our Discord channel.

### Q5: How can we get feedback or clarifications on our proposals? 

A: Due to a high volume of requests, the grant team cannot provide individual feedback. However, feedback or clarifications on proposals can only be received through community support on our Discord channel.

### Q6: Can we establish direct and efficient communication channels for technical discussions?

A: We primarily offer financial support for projects related to the Swarm network and its adoption.

### Q8: Are there any restrictions on the use of grant funds? 

A: Yes, grant funds should be utilised as per the stipulated guidelines and focusing primarily on the approved milestones. Any deviations can lead to a reassessment of the grant agreement.

### Q9: Can a project receive additional funding if the scope of work expands during implementation? 

A: If the scope of work expands, applicants can apply for another subsequent grant to cover the additional requirements.

## IV. Assessment & Review Process

## V. Milestones & Reporting

### Q13: How important is it to define project milestones in the agreement? 

A: It’s crucial to define clear project milestones in the agreement as they should reflect how the project would utilize Swarm. They are pivotal for the progression of the project and subsequent agreements.

### Q14: How can applicants track the progress of their submission? 

A: We will reach out to you regarding the progress of your submission. Please note, this might take up to 4-6 weeks.

A: There is no limit to the number of applications an individual or organisation can submit.

## VII. Ideas & Community Engagement

### Q18: Can we share our project ideas on Discord? 

A: Absolutely, sharing your idea on Discord is encouraged. It opens up your project to diverse opinions, and it remains your project. To secure your project, it is recommended to start with a White Paper (WP).

### Q19: What is the deadline for grant submissions?
