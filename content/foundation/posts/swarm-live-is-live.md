**Swarm Live was the last event before Swarm 1.0**

Swarm Live was launched on Tuesday, 24 November 2020. All the polished, new, and improved features were discussed in detail at the [Swarm Live online event](https://ethswarm.medium.com/swarm-live-event-programme-announcement-d71176c6e8cd), where the team presented not only what’s new, but also many other interesting topics, the Swarm incentives among them.

# Swarm Live Event Recap

**Part 1: Swarm’s Introduction and Vision**

The event kicked off with a **fireside chat between** [**Viktor Tron**](https://twitter.com/zeligf) **and** [**Michelle**](https://twitter.com/kingflurkel). They discussed Swarm’s vision from a broader perspective. The conversation was inspirational and formed a nice intro to **our guest speaker,** [**Scott Beibin**](https://twitter.com/scottbeibin)**,** co-founder of [Evil Twin Booking](https://eviltwinbooking.org/), where he represents people like [Chelsea Manning](https://eviltwinbooking.org/speakers/chelsea-manning/) and [Glenn Greenwald](https://eviltwinbooking.org/speakers/glenn-greenwald/); he is into open-source hardware design, sustainable futurism, and crypto-economics. He talked about the importance of privacy, the freedom to share data, free societies, and having a world where we wouldn’t need to worry about censorship that much.

**Part 2: Join the network**

Here’s where we touched upon what Swarm Live is. **Swarm’s mission was explained directly by one of the founders of Swarm — Daniel Nagy**. [Rinke Hendriksen](https://twitter.com/HendriksenRinke) explained **how the Swarm incentives work** and how the long months of extensive research on this topic finally put together all the pieces of the puzzle. [**Janoš Guljaš**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janosguljas/) **presented what’s new and improved** in the Swarm Live release. Finally, we concluded this section with t**he newly established SwarmJS team** who will be working on enabling building DApps on top of Swarm.

**Part 3: Build with Swarm + Demo time**

If there is anything you should really take away from this event, **it’s the possibility of joining the network in its early stages**. [DAppNode](https://dappnode.io/) makes it amazingly easy to install and run your own Swarm node. A demo with clear instructions on how to do so (by [Eduardo Antuña Díez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduadiez/) — DAppNode Project Lead) followed.

Dan Nickless and Vojtech Simetka showed off the **Zero-leak Messaging demo**, **FairOS libraries** were demoed by [Zahoor Mohamed](https://twitter.com/jmohamedzahoor).

**Swarm grants — 3rd wave announcement**

To further boost our fast-growing ecosystem, the 3rd wave of Swarm grants was announced. Projects who haven’t applied for a Swarm grant yet: here’s your chance to get BZZ to fund your project. [Apply for the grants here](https://swarmgrants.typeform.com/to/O3qL6VdO).

**Part 4: Future, Team AMA, and closing of the event**

Michelle briefly recapped the event and opened the floor to the audience, who had the Swarm team at their disposal for AMA-related topics.

The entire event can be re-watched online via the Twitter [live streaming link](https://twitter.com/ethswarm/status/1331219946865532929).
