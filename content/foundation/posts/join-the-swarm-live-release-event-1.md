Swarm is happy to announce yet another important milestone on the roadmap: Swarm Live. This special occasion will be celebrated with another online event, where all the new, improved, and polished features will be presented. Details of the event’s programme are still being worked on, but you can be sure it’s going to be packed with interesting talks, demos, and speakers.

Rinke Hendriksen, product owner of Bee: _“The last months the pieces of the Swarm incentives puzzle have come together. I’m happy to finally share the resulting image to the community.”_

[Please RSVP to the event and reserve your seat at the presentation of Swarm Live on 24 November 2020 at 14:00 CET](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/live.swarm.eth/).

# Your turn! Test your ideas and start earning gBZZ

Swarm Live is the last release before the fully developed product: Swarm 1.0. The Live release has all the Beta features nicely polished, bugs fixed, enhanced performance, and stability. It also has all of the high-level features of Swarm 1.0 in place. And with it also the possibility to “make money”. Well, not yet real money, as we’re talking about gBcZZ (goerli BZZ), but it will serve as a nice simulation for you to test your dApp ideas on.

Gregor Žavcer, Swarm Ops: _“This time, the event is all about Respect. Respect for the ecosystem, dApp developers and all the projects that create the future of decentralised storage.”_

# Get a head start in an emerging ecosystem

When Android started, some clever people knew they had to act fast. Even the simplest of apps, like the torchlight one, gained a lot of traffic and downloads. It’s a lot easier to be amongst the first in an emerging ecosystem than to follow later.

Join the ever-growing number of projects that have already started to build on top of Swarm and be among the first to benefit from this new ecosystem.

During the event, another wave of Swarm grants will be announced to help you make that dApp dream a reality.

The easiest way to help create the decentralised future is probably starting a DappNode. Eduardo Antuña Díez, DAppNode Project Lead: _“With Bee running on DappNode, every node operator has an easy inroad to the Swarm network. I’ll be showing how easy it is to run your own Bee.”_

# What can you expect at the event?

The event will be two-and-a-half hours of useful information, presentations, and talks. You will hear from the team and you will be able to ask your questions at the closing AMA.

More details on the event programme will follow soon; make sure you follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ethswarm) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethswarm) accounts for updates, but most importantly, [RSVP to the event here](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/live.swarm.eth/).

See you at the event!
