In this month's analysis, we will turn our attention to the Swarm network's performance in December, comparing it with previous months to draw insights into evolving trends and developments. Our report delves into key metrics such as total monthly rewards, median and average win values, and the average earnings per active staking node. Notably, we'll discuss the network's adaptation to an increasingly competitive staking landscape, highlighting the resilience and efficiency of Swarm's economic model and pricing mechanism.

### Data Considerations

The "Active staking node" metric is defined as any full node with a reserve size greater than zero which has submitted a commit transaction during the month in question. This definition, introduced last month, provides a more accurate reflection of active participation in the network.

## Network Total Monthly Rewards

This metric shows the total rewards paid out across the entire network for each month.

| Month     | Total Network Rewards (xBZZ) |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| July      | 34,839                        |
| August    | 13,5927                       |
| September | 147,825                       |
| October   | 152,868                       |
| November  | 148,617                       |
| **December** | **159,865**                |

![chart-Total-Network-Monthly-Rewards](/uploads/chart-Total-Network-Monthly-Rewards-December.png)

In December, a record 159,865 xBZZ in rewards were issued to node operators, representing a moderate increase in network utilisation. This growth in rewards, fuelled by demand for data storage services, demonstrates the network's healthy utilisation and efficiency.  

## Monthly Median Win Values

This metric is the median win amount for each win event.

| Month     | Median Win Values (xBZZ) |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| July      | 9.63                      |
| August    | 43.97                     |
| September | 44.62                     |
| October   | 46.84                     |
| November  | 46.83                     |
| **December** | **48.06**            |

![chart-Monthly-Median-Win-Values](/uploads/chart-Monthly-Median-Win-Values-December.png)

December saw a slight increase in the median win value to 48.06 xBZZ, demonstrating a consistent and reliable reward size for win events.

## Monthly Average Win Values

This metric is the average win amount for each win event.

| Month     | Average Win Values (xBZZ) |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| July      | 12.07                      |
| August    | 41.45                      |
| September | 46.52                      |
| October   | 62.09                      |
| November  | 47.41                      |
| **December** | **57.75**            |

![chart-Monthly-Average-Win-Values](/uploads/chart-Monthly-Average-Win-Values-December.png)

The average win value in December climbed to 57.75 xBZZ, reflecting an increase from November and underscoring the network's dynamic reward system and self sustaining economic model.

## Active Staking Node Monthly Average Earnings

This metric shows the average monthly earnings for an active staking node.

| Month     | Avg Total Earnings per Node (xBZZ) |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| July      | 13.11                              |
| August    | 31.11                              |
| September | 32.31                              |
| October   | 14.73                              |
| November  | 7.12                               |
| **December** | **19.10**                    |

![chart-Avg-Total-Earnings-per-Node](/uploads/chart-Avg-Total-Earnings-per-Node-December.png)

December observed an increase in average earnings per active staking node to 19.10 xBZZ. This rise, amidst a decrease in the total number of nodes, is demonstrative of the network's economic model working properly and adjusting rewards in response to an increase in staking competition.

## Total Active Staking Nodes by Month

This metric shows the total active staking nodes by month. 

| Month     | Total Active Staking Nodes |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| July      | 2,657                       |
| August    | 4,368                       |

![chart-Number-of-Winning-Staking-Nodes-by-Month](/uploads/chart-Number-of-Winning-Staking-Nodes-by-Month-December.png)

While November marked a peak with 2,787 winning nodes, December saw a decrease to 2,308. This is reflective of the decrease in total staking nodes for this month.

## Total Active Staking Nodes by Country

This metric shows the total number of active staking nodes across various countries.

|               | China | Germany | Finland | Unknown | United States | Other |
|---------------|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|-------|

| **December**   |  **4,730**|  **1,732**  |**1,580**  | **13** | **275**  | **44**   |


![Total Staking Nodes by Country](/uploads/Total-Active-Staking-Nodes-by-Country-December.png)

In December, there was a notable reshuffling in the distribution of active staking nodes, with a significant reduction in China and adjustments across other regions. This redistribution reflects the network's dynamic nature and adaptable economic model.

## Conclusion

Over the last six months, the Swarm network has shown considerable resilience and adaptability. The shifts in total monthly rewards, win values, and the average earnings per node underscore a network that is not only growing but also evolving in its economic dynamics and network utilisation. The changing landscape of active node across different countries highlights Swarm's influence in the decentralized storage space. These developments point towards an active, expanding, and diversifying network.
