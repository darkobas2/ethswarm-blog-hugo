September saw a fresh stream of new releases, announcements and publications that reflect Swarm’s evolving vitality. A new [Bee 1.17.4](https://blog.ethswarm.org/foundation/2023/bee-1-17-4-pre-announcement/) is out and it comes with a sizable changelog, a **breaking change** (make sure to update your node) and **improved user experience for node operators**.

The **[Price Oracle](https://blog.staging.ethswarm.org/foundation/2023/oracle-overview/)** and deliverables from **Phase 4** of the storage incentives roadmap are now **on testnet**. A new version of [Swarm Desktop](https://www.ethswarm.org/build/desktop) has also been released to sync with the changes of the new Bee.

Jumping over to the ecosystem side – if you’re looking for a grant to help you build/upgrade your project on the Swarm network, **the Full Moon grants wave is open** ([apply here](https://my.ethswarm.org/grants)). You can apply for a grant of up to 10,000 DAI in BZZ. [Fairdrive Web App](https://app.fairdrive.fairdatasociety.org/) has undergone a significant UI change, and a fully decentralised vector database [FaVe](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/FaVe) has also joined Fair Data Society’s suite of offerings (note that FaVe is still under development).

Four new blogs are also available to read on [Swarm’s official blog](https://blog.ethswarm.org/) and you can now [mark your calendar](https://www.addevent.com/event/Ky18866277) for the October Swarm Community Call, which will take place on 26 October at 17:00 CET.

## Tracks

### Bee Track

#### [Release 1.17.4](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/releases/tag/v1.17.4) is out with the following:

- Improved logging for the pushsync and the retrieval protocols. Note: This is a breaking change so node operators need to proceed as soon as possible with upgrading their nodes.
- Default batch type is now immutable. This ensures that stamp purchasers do not unintentionally overwrite their uploaded data by accident.
- Swap-enable set to false by default. A fresh install, if no other options are changed, bee start command gets the node in ultra-light mode rather than throwing an error.
  Note: full node operators should have this set to false
- Upload type is now deferred by default. This means that upload data is first uploaded to the local Bee node before being uploaded to the Swarm network

#### Logging improvment

Logging has been improved, offering benefits in two key aspects:

- Node operators will experience enhanced usability through more meaningful messages and relevant information.
- Developers will gain a better understanding of the technical details, assisting them in debugging the code.

### Research Track

- The Phase 4 and Phase 3 deliverables of the inclusion proofs and the [Price Oracle](https://blog.staging.ethswarm.org/foundation/2023/oracle-overview/) are now being deployed to testnet, where we are assessing and making ready for a wider release.
- We are exploring how we can assist the wider hardening phase with any research or contract-based changes that may include doubling reserve sizes, assisting changes to reward variance, etc.
- The solution doc for erasure codes is complete and the EPIC kickoff will begin after the ph4 mainnet release. This will be Research’s key goal between now and EOY.

### JS Track

#### Swarm Desktop App

- [New release](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-desktop/releases/tag/v0.30.0) of Swarm Desktop is out which bundles the most recent Bee version, 1.17.4.

### Grants

#### [Swarm Full Moon Grant Wave](https://my.ethswarm.org/grants)

- New grant wave started: The Swarm Association launches the [Swarm Full Moon Grant Wave](https://my.ethswarm.org/grants) from 23 September to 21 December, inviting a diverse cohort of developers, researchers and artists to contribute to the creation of the inaugural Web3 PC, all while championing the principles of digital freedom and decentralised technologies. With a generous grant pool of 300,000 BZZ tokens, participants can apply for grants up to 10,000 DAI in BZZ and pursue further funding through follow-up grants upon successfully reaching initial milestones.

### Ecosystem

#### Swarmscan

- A new page has been added to [Swarmscan](https://swarmscan.io/), indicating the least populated [neighbourhoods](https://swarmscan.io/neighborhoods). Node operators can use this information to target specific neighbourhoods when establishing new nodes.

#### Fair Data Protocol

##### [Fairdrive Web App](https://app.fairdrive.fairdatasociety.org/)

- Fairdrive has undergone substantial [UI changes](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-theapp/pull/524) to simplify the login process and improve the user experience when working with pods and folders. Additionally, the process of [uploading](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-theapp/pull/514) and retrieving files has been made more intuitive and user-friendly.
- Metamask login and account migration (lite-fdp-account to full-fdp-account in app) received straightforward instructions with [new gas estimation](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-theapp/pull/505).
- Redesigned how [the folder path](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-theapp/pull/500) is shown on mobile.
- Between many UI upgrades, [import feat is cancelled](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-theapp/pull/518) due to the login simplification process.
- [Other enhancements & fixes](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-theapp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2023-09-01..2023-09-30+)

#### [Blossom](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/blossom/tree/master)

#### [FaVe](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/FaVe)

- Introducing a new truly decentralised vector database build with Fair Data Principles in mind. This comes as a cherry on top of fairOS, with LangChain integration and standalone python client. It enables a secure semantic search on your documents and allows you to run private GPTs with data on Swarm.
- Vectorizer is a Python server that uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to convert text into embeddings and returns the embeddings as JSON that can be stored in FaVe.
- The project was introduced in the latest Swarm Community Call.

#### [FairPortal](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fair-portal)

- [New feat:](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fair-portal/pull/13) users can now edit each record by adding new dApp information and reuploading, without creating a new record in the smart contract.

#### [FDA](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-desktop-app)
