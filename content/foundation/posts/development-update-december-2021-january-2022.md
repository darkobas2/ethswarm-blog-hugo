With 2021 behind us, the Swarm team entered the new year at the usual pace, working hard to make Swarm features complete by the end of the year.

December was an important month, full of notable achievements. Not only did the team successfully meet their [first technical milestone](https://medium.com/ethereum-swarm/announcing-the-swarm-foundation-technical-milestones-e66bba8dc6b) (persistent and reliable storage of small files), but they also presented the ecosystem roadmap and made other important announcements on the [Gather, Swarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJMybgus40)! event.

2021 will always remain a special one for the Swarm organisation. Let’s take a look at some of the major milestones that were reached last year:

- The private and public token sale; Swarm gets funded
- Swarm Foundation is established
- Swarm testnet airdrop — March to August 2021
- Mainnet launch in June 2021
- The Swarm Summer School — August 2021
- First waves of grant projects kickstarted Swarm’s ecosystem (now with more than 60 projects already building on Swarm)
- Technical & ecosystem roadmaps — December 2021
- The network becomes reliable for uploading and downloading small files

After a short and well-deserved new year’s break, the Swarm team continued with the work towards the next milestones on the technical roadmap.

**Make sure you don’t miss the We Are Millions hackathon**

From 1–21 March, artists, gamers, developers, activists, crypto and non-crypto people will come together in the 2nd [Fair Data Society](https://fairdatasociety.org/) Festival & Hackathon, organised by Swarm & Partners.

## **Research Track**

**December 2021:**

- We entered a new phase in the research of storage incentives. From adversarial thinking, trying to push the boundaries of what is possible, to consolidating and clearly defining where we arrived. Currently, two methodologies of doing postage redistribution are candidates
- The research team worked on a proposal to make the push sync protocol more resilient to the observed network conditions

**January 2022:**

- Further specifying “density proofs”, which is a compacted proof in which the node reveals how many chunks it was storing–part of the storage incentive scheme
- Addressing issues related to density proofs and how they could potentially be created without actually storing the required chunks
- Started specifying the smart-contracts needed for the storage incentives scheme

## **Ecosystem Track**

**December 2021:**

- The ecosystem roadmap was presented at the Gather, Swarm! event. If you missed it, you can watch the recording of the event on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJMybgus40).
