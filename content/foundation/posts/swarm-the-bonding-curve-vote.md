On 29th of February 2024, following questions raised regarding the present relevance of the design of the Swarm bonding curve, the Swarm Foundation announced that the existence of the bonding curve is going to be subject to a vote to either shut it down, or validate its existence.

The vote on the [bonding curve](https://blog.ethswarm.org/foundation/2021/swarm-and-its-bzzaar-bonding-curve/) will take place in a few weeks. The initial timeline of the vote is presented hereunder, while further details of the vote will be communicated to the community shortly.

The bonding curve has been part of the initial design of the Swarm network, playing a critical role in providing liquidity and price transparency. Yet, innovation always requires reflection and adaptation, considering the complexities and challenges that come with new technologies and new phases of a project. For this reason, the decision on whether or not to keep the bonding curve mechanism will be placed directly in the hands of those to whom it belongs: the community, reflecting Swarm Foundation’s commitment to empowering the community. 

## The bonding curve

The bonding curve is a mathematical function that automatically adjusts the token price in relation to its supply, offering a transparent and predictable mechanism for token pricing. It was initially deployed to increase resilience to price manipulation and have a fair distribution system that discourages inflation, while making the token available for purchase irrespective of the market supply and demand (more info can be found [here](https://blog.ethswarm.org/foundation/2021/swarm-and-its-bzzaar-bonding-curve/)). 

However, after almost three years, it’s now time for the community of token holders to decide which direction they would like Swarm to take.

*Timeline*
* Announcement of the vote: 29 February
* Voting opens: 28 March
* Voting closes: 25 April
* Potential shutdown of the bonding curve: 4 May, contingent upon community consensus.

## Governance

The upcoming vote represents more than just a decision on the bonding curve: it’s the first step towards decentralising the decision making process around the Swarm Network, enacting Swarm community's power in shaping the path forward. This process is a testament to the Swarm Foundation’s shared commitment to create a decentralised future for the web.

More details will come. In the meantime, join the discussion on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/799027393297514537/808329804268699678). 

Together, let's decide our path forward.
