June marked an important point in the Swarm network development. The new localstore was released on private and public testnet and the new revised and updated edition of the [Book of Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org/The-Book-of-Swarm.pdf) is now available. The Research Track has also made it much easier to find nodes that couldn’t enter the storage incentives game and understand the circumstances.

The [Swarm Virtual Summit](https://blog.ethswarm.org/foundation/2023/swarm-virtual-summit-swarm-is-ready.-ready-to-grow./) is successfully behind us. **Over 20 inspiring and educational presentations** on the use of Swarm and other decentralised technologies are available for viewing. Grab yourself [early access to Fairdrive Web App](https://join.fairdrive.io/) and get some free storage while you’re at it. [Swarm docs have a great new look and feel](https://docs.ethswarm.org/) and if you’re interested in building value-driven digital ecosystems, the Hivemaker’s Code by theLivingCore and Swarm is [available here](https://toolkit.ethswarm.org/). There have also been numerous bug fixes and updates across the entire Swarm stack.

## Bee Track

#### Released [v2.0.0-rc5](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc5)

- The new localstore is on private and public testnets and optimisations are being made to up the upload speed so that we can release to mainnet.
- We have also experienced a perfect month of network activity with 0% error rates on our smoke tests.
- The joint effort from DevRel and Bee team has resulted in the openAPI and protocol specs and diagrams being completed and pending release.

## Research Track

- The latest edition of the [Book of Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org/The-Book-of-Swarm.pdf) is out.
- Phase 4 optimisations and refactoring is complete and its release window is being scheduled.
- We have successfully redeveloped our stats dashboard to find our nodes that did not enter the storage incentives and can now debug the logs to understand the circumstances around nodes not playing the game and how often this occurs.

## Ecosystem
