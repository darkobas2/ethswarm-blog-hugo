## Wikipedia on Swarm was just the beginning

The Swarm Foundation is proud to announce the second phase of its
partnership with [Kiwix](https://www.kiwix.org/en/), an offline data storer, marking another decisive
step in creating a thriving and value-driven ecosystem. Kiwix and the
Swarm Foundation [initially partnered](/hive/2022/kiwix-and-swarm-partner-up-to-preserve-free-online-access-to-information/) in 2022 to [bring an offline copy of
Wikipedia](/hive/2022/announcing-50k-dai-prize-to-make-wikipedia-unstoppable/) on to the Swarm Network. Now the time has come to extend the
partnership to preserve and democratise access to important and publicly
available data.

Summit**](https://swarm.streameth.org/session/88NEY8)

_"The internet is fragmenting and we need to look at a near future
where not all information is available to everyone. And we need to find
new ways to counter this,"_ Stephane-Coillet Matillon, CEO and
co-founder of Kiwix, emphasises the reason why they decided to level up
the partnership.

Kiwix will join the upcoming **Great Data Upload** initiative, which aims to
preserve accessible and important public data by uploading open datasets
to Swarm. Both projects believe that every individual should have the
freedom to access, share and benefit from humanity's collective
knowledge, unhindered by their geographic location.

## Championing the freedom of information

By storing Kiwix's content, Swarm Foundation's vision of storing the
world's data moves closer to becoming reality. This will allow
individuals everywhere greater access to information, bridging the
digital divide.

## About Kiwix

Kiwix is a non-profit and open source organisation that has made it its
mission to make knowledge and information available to all humanity.
They compress huge amounts of data (think really large websites) into
small packages that can be viewed with their Kiwix viewer even on
low-speced devices with no internet connection. This makes such data
available even where internet access is limited, making Kiwix a valuable
alternative for under-resourced communities.

## #PowerToThePeople

The partnership between the Swarm Foundation and Kiwix reiterates the
Foundation's Commitment to defending and making humanity's knowledge
available to everyone.

Join us and help give power back to the people!
