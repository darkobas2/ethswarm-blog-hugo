Swarm Foundation is proud to announce that Swarm 1.0 is live on mainnet. This special release will be celebrated with an online event, Swarm One, where the developer teams will explain everything users need to know about the first mainnet release and what to expect in the future.

# **Register for the Swarm One event!**

**When:** 21 June 2021 at 15:00 CET
**Where:** [register for the event here](https://bit.ly/3cFNIsI)

# **About Swarm 1.0**

Swarm 1.0 is the result of truly hard work: extensive research, experimentation, and iterations on the software, with several releases throughout the year. Today, Swarm is both simpler and more powerful than originally envisioned. Throughout this journey, Swarmâ€™s wonderful community and Bee node operators have all contributed equally to creating Swarm 1.0 as it is today.

# **Swarm is not done, this is just the beginning**

With all that said, it is important to state that this is just the beginning of a new era for Swarm, with endless possibilities ahead.

# **What can I expect at the event?**

We are still working on the exact programme, but attendees can expect three hours of interesting talks, presentations, and valuable insights into Swarm 1.0 and its nearest future. [Please register for the event](https://bit.ly/3cFNIsI) to stay updated.
