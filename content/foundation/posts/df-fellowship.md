[Swarm fellowships](https://www.ethswarm.org/fellowships) are designed to support individuals and teams working on critical projects that help the Swarm network evolve and grow. These projects, while vital to Swarm’s development, are distinct from core Swarm work. Fellows are encouraged to pursue long-term goals aligned with their fellowship, aiming for outcomes that can be sustained independently after the fellowship ends. This approach fosters innovation and decentralisation while allowing fellows to become long-term ambassadors of the Swarm network.

Fellowships span various categories, from decentralised protocols addressing specific challenges (such as communication, personal data management, or supply chain solutions) to developer tools, end-user applications, and infrastructure improvements supporting the Swarm network. Importantly, all work is made available as open source, allowing the community to benefit from and build on these innovations.


## Data Provenance and AI: A Cutting-Edge Fellowship

One such pioneering initiative is [Datafund's](https://datafund.io) *Data and Model Provenance for Decentralised AI* fellowship, which focuses on developing a toolkit for tracking the provenance of data and models in AI applications. Provenance—the ability to track and verify the origins and transformations of data and AI models—is becoming increasingly important in AI development, especially with growing ethical concerns and regulatory requirements.

This fellowship is at the forefront of addressing these issues, utilizing Swarm’s decentralised storage and blockchain technology and Datafund’s expertise in AI. By creating a system that records and tracks data provenance, the project will ensure greater transparency, accountability, and compliance with ethical standards. Furthermore, this will showcase the potential of Swarm and other Web3 technologies, creating a foundation that future decentralised AI projects can build on.


## A Framework for Ethical AI Development

The key objectives of this fellowship are to ensure ethical AI practices by securely recording data origins and transformations, addressing both regulatory compliance and the growing demand for transparency in AI development. Through the use of Swarm storage and blockchain, the project provides secure attestation and verification, making the process tamper-proof and trustworthy.

This project also offers research insights into the attractiveness of Swarm for AI companies and engages the broader community through the Swarm Improvement Proposal (SWIP) process. It serves as an open-source toolkit for any developer or organization looking to implement decentralised, compliant AI solutions, paving the way for new use cases such as crowdsourcing foundational models from contributed datasets.


## The Business Use Case and Future Sustainability

Beyond the fellowship, the project’s toolkit offers immense business potential. By addressing regulatory needs for provenance and compliance, it will attract stakeholders from sectors like healthcare, finance, and research—industries that require reliable, transparent, and secure data handling. The toolkit’s open-source nature allows the broader community to build on it, fostering continuous improvement and new applications.

Moreover, this initiative aligns closely with [Datafund’s](https://datafund.io) focus on decentralised AI and the Fair Data Economy. The toolkit will become an integral component of Datafund’s solutions, ensuring continued development and maintenance, backed by a growing ecosystem.


## A Blueprint for Success

The *Data and Model Provenance for Decentralised AI* fellowship is more than just a project—it’s a step forward for ethical, compliant, and decentralised AI. By leveraging Swarm storage and blockchain, it not only solves pressing challenges in AI but also demonstrates the broader potential of Web3 technologies. Its success will be measured by the adoption of Swarm within the AI sector, the open-source community’s engagement, and the implementation of new, innovative decentralised AI applications.

As [Swarm fellowships](https://www.ethswarm.org/fellowships) continue to support groundbreaking work, this project is a prime example of how decentralised technologies can shape the future, opening the door to a new wave of decentralised storage and AI solutions.
