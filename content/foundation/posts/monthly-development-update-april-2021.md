April was a heads-down / work-hard month for the Swarm team. A lot of things have been going on in the background. We’re proud to share our progress.

- The team was getting ready for the Swarm v0.6.0 release. Some of you had a chance to get a taste of it at the public [demo with Rinke Hendriksen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GVJeWKgoLk).
- The JS team released the [Bee dashboard](https://medium.com/ethereum-swarm/bee-dashboard-f3dcb4172b52) that will make it easier to install and operate nodes.
- Fair Data Society organized a nice, [two-day long event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-6Y-ybYu4g&list=PLM3tjfrjbdAlj--5jVvW9GohxdCjavHKi) that covered topics related to the fair data economy and provided educational videos for the web3 community.

You can read the monthly development progress report in more detail below.

[All the videos are uploaded to the Fair Data Society YouTube channel and you are invited to rewatch the talks if you missed the event.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-6Y-ybYu4g&list=PLM3tjfrjbdAlj--5jVvW9GohxdCjavHKi)
